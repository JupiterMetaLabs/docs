# Decentralized Identity (DID)

## **What is Decentralized Identity (DID)?**

ZKJM implements **W3C-standardized Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** to provide users with **self-sovereign identities**, enabling **secure authentication across dApps, DeFi platforms, and enterprise services**.

### **Key Features of DID in ZKJM**
- ✅ **Privacy-Preserving Authentication** → DID-based logins without exposing personal data.
- ✅ **Interoperability with Web3 & Enterprises** → Works across **multiple blockchain networks and enterprise applications**.
- ✅ **Self-Sovereign Identity** → Users have full control over their credentials, reducing reliance on centralized identity providers.
- ✅ **Enhanced Security** → **Zero-Knowledge cryptography** ensures verifiable yet private transactions.
