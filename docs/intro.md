# Introduction

## What is JupiterMetaZK (ZKJM)?

JupiterMetaZK (ZKJM) is an **Ethereum-based Layer 2 (L2) blockchain** designed to enhance **scalability, privacy, and security** for decentralized applications (dApps) and enterprise use cases. By leveraging **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Decentralized Identity (DID), and the Non-Negotiable Sequential Synchronization (NNSS) consensus mechanism**, ZKJM provides a highly efficient and interoperable blockchain infrastructure.

### **Why Choose ZKJM?**
-  **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Enables private transactions and computations without exposing sensitive data.
-  **Decentralized Identity (DID):** W3C-standardized identifiers for secure and PII-protected user authentication.
- **Layer 2 Scaling:** Optimized throughput using **zk-rollups** and immutable ledger-based state synchronization.
- **NNSS Consensus Algorithm:** A hybrid approach integrating **Raft, Gossip Protocol, and Bloom Filters** for efficient data synchronization.
- **Ethereum Interoperability:** Supports seamless integration with **Ethereum smart contracts, DeFi applications, and enterprise solutions**.
- **Efficient L1 Commitments:** Transactions dynamically committed to Ethereum **based on optimal gas fees and block time**.
- **Immutable Storage:** Ensures tamper-proof and verifiable data recording.
- **Privacy-Preserving Queries:** DID-based querying for secure, controlled access to blockchain data.
