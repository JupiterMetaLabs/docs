# Zero-Knowledge Rollups

## **ZK-Rollups for Scalable Transactions**

JMDT leverages **zk-rollups** to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof before submitting them to Ethereum (L1). This approach ensures **lower gas fees, reduced congestion, and improved efficiency**.

### **How ZK-Rollups Work**
✅ **Batching Transactions** → Multiple L2 transactions are aggregated.
✅ **Generating Proofs** → ZK-SNARKs/STARKs verify the correctness of transactions.
✅ **On-Chain Commitment** → The final proof is submitted to Ethereum for finality.

### **Advantages of ZK-Rollups in JMDT**
✔ **Scalability** → Processes thousands of transactions off-chain before settlement.
✔ **Privacy** → Uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** to ensure confidentiality.
✔ **Lower Gas Fees** → Reduces L1 congestion and transaction costs.
